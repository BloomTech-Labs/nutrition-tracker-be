// macros tab
// each graph has a baseline
// db is taking track of calories from macro
// add all three calories together, 100% in total
// need percentage of each calorie per category... ie, fat, protein, carbs
// break each one up into a percentage

// ie target carbs vs actual carbs, etc
// daily nutrition goals is daily goal
// get route for each macro
// maybe make a helper that spits back out all three macros

//applicable start date is today's date

// daily cal: 2000, daily fat: 400, daily carb: 600, daily protein: 1000

// daily macro / total daily cals
// how are we going to return the data across time

// endpoint will serve an object:
/*
dates: [],
fats: [],
protein: [],
carbs: []
